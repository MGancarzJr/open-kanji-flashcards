# open-kanji-flashcards
Open-source kanji flashcard repository.

This is an open-source kanji flashcard project. The aim is to create a set of printable flashcards in LaTeX of both individual (N5 through N1) and compound Kanji (jukugo) for the purpose of learning. The focus is on simplicity and readability. A familiarity with both hiragana and katakana is a prerequisite for full use as kun'yomi and furigana-like pronounciation will be written in this script, and on'yomi will be written in katakana.

A goal is to utilize crowdsourcing in the selection of compound kanji in order to best reflect commonly used words. Contributions are welcome.
